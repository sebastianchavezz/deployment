Create and deploy a web application on heroku using Flask that displays and visualize some insides. The data was provided as a json file. For this challenge we needed to make a sql database and read from it. 

## Mission Objectives

- Be able to parse json files
- Be able to build and deploy an app using Flask, docker, and heroku
- Be able to save json data into an SQL database
- Be able to design a relational SQL database
- Be able to visualize data from a SQL database
- Be able to deploy said database alongside (interactive) visualizations

## Installation

for the installation run the command: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

The [website](https://steamgamessebas.herokuapp.com/) is quite primitive, what you are going to see is a filtered dataset that I provided with some features that were challenging to get.
